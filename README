This plugin defines key mappings to quickly make the GUI font larger or
smaller. The default mappings are "+" to make the font larger by 1 point
and "-" to make the font smaller by 1 point. The original font size can
be restored with "=" key at any time. The mappings are user-configurable
(see the installation section below).

This plugin should work on Unix and Win32 but it will work only with
certain patterns of 'guifont' option, namely:

 - on Unix, 'guifont' should be set to the X Logical Font Description
   (XLFD) name, for example:

      set guifont=-*-lucidatypewriter-bold-*-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

 - on Win32, 'guifont' should include 'hXX' font option, for example:

      set guifont=Lucida_Console:h8:cANSI

Please let me know if this is not good enough for you.
